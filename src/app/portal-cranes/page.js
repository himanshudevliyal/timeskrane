                TK KRANE full-portal cranes can often be integrated into
                existing production facilities and inhouse logistics processes
                with only little design effort. They mainly differ from
                semi-portal cranes by having an integrated articulated leg,
                which compensates any movements. The load-bearing crane girder
                is part of the frame structure which, together with the legs at
                either end, forms a travelling bridge. The cranes run on ground
                rails, which eliminates the need for a crane runway. Full-portal
                cranes are preferably used for outdoor operation in storage
                yards and loading areas.
